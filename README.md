Getting started!

This is a little background about me. I am a data science student going through my first full-length project here on my Github! I received my Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2017. Although I am from Nebraska, I am now living in Chicago where I have worked as a data analyst for the past few years now.
